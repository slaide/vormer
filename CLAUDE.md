- this project is fundamentally about vulkan, so any create and destroy functions should follow the same pattern, i.e. they return an error value (if it makes sense, e.g. destroy doesnt return anything, and if a create function cannot fail it also returns nothing, otherwise there are domain specific return enums), and the last argument to the create functions is a pointer where the value will be constructed.
